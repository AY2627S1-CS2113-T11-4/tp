## Design & implementation
### Edit feature

The edit feature lets the user change a game's title and/or player range without deleting and re-adding it.

**Parsing.** `Parser#parseEdit` splits the arguments just before each field prefix (`/title`, `/min`, `/max`),
so the fields can be given in any order. The first part is the `INDEX`, which is checked by `Parser#parseIndex`
(shared with `delete`). Each field is then checked on its own, e.g. `MIN` must be a whole number of at least 1,
and `TITLE` must not contain `|`. A field that is not given is passed to `EditCommand` as `null`,
meaning "keep the current value".

**Execution.** `EditCommand#execute` first checks that a game with that number exists. It then builds the new game,
taking each given field and falling back to the existing game's value for any field that was not given. Only then is
`MAX >= MIN` checked, because this rule depends on the game's current values (e.g. `edit 1 /min 5` must fail if the
game's current maximum is 4). If the check passes, `GameList#set` replaces the game at the same position and
`Storage#save` writes the updated collection to the data file.

**Design considerations.**
* *Where to check MIN/MAX:* the parser does not have access to the game list, so it cannot know the game's
  existing values. The check is therefore done in `EditCommand`, in the same way that `DeleteCommand` checks
  whether the index exists when it runs.
* *Replace in place vs. delete and re-add:* replacing keeps the game's number in `list` unchanged,
  which is less confusing for the user.
